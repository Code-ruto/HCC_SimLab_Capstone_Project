# SimBot Launcher

A voice-interactive AI chatbot simulation application built with Python that features multiple personas and conversational AI capabilities.

## 📋 Overview

SimBot Launcher is a Python-based conversational AI application that uses voice input/output to interact with users. I used the Python library edge-tts by Microsoft to generate responses with neural text-to-speech powered by Azure Cognitive Services.

In 2025, I was selected to intern at Houston City College's Coleman campus. My capstone project is a conceptual chatbot that interacts with dialogue. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate potential uses for AI in assisting students undergoing simulation lab training at Houston City College.

## 🎯 Features

- **Voice Input/Output**: Integrated speech recognition and AI-powered text-to-speech capabilities
- **Multiple Personas**: Choose between different conversation personalities (Number One, Number Two)
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular design separating concerns (Voice, Logic, Modules)
- **Conversational AI**: Simulated conversation engine with persona-based responses
- **Neural TTS**: High-quality AI-generated speech using Microsoft Edge's neural engine

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Speech Recognition**: `SpeechRecognition`
- **Text-to-Speech**: `edge-tts` (Microsoft Edge neural TTS powered by Azure Cognitive Services)
- **Audio Processing**: `PyAudio`
- **HTTP Client**: `aiohttp`

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Code-ruto/Final_Project.git
cd Final_Project
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

The application will:
1. Prompt you to choose a persona ("Number One" or "Number Two")
2. Listen for your voice input
3. Process your input through the selected persona
4. Respond with voice output and continue the conversation

### About Edge-TTS

**edge-tts** is a Python library that leverages Microsoft Edge's neural text-to-speech engine, powered by Azure Cognitive Services. It uses advanced AI models to:
- Convert text to natural-sounding speech with multiple voice options
- Support various languages and regional accents
- Provide prosody control (pitch, rate, volume) for expressive speech synthesis
- Generate high-quality audio without requiring API keys or cloud credentials

This enables SimBot Launcher to produce realistic voice responses that sound human-like and contextually appropriate to each persona.

## 🎤 Voice Commands

The application listens for:
- **"number one"** - Select the first persona
- **"number two"** - Select the second persona
